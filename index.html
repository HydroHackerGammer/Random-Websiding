            <p>
                We first came to the Idea of a clima friendly powerfull
                energie producer <br> when we saw the amount of CO2 a typicel
                coal fired powerd plant (CFPP)produce. <br> From that day on we tried 
                to create an other opption next to the CFPP.
            </p>

        <section id="how">

            <h1>How did we get here!</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We soon made huge advances and made a small prototype only
                after 3 month. <br> Even with the first prototype we managed to
                be 10% more environmentmentally <br> friendly then a standart CFPP.
                In the last 2 years we worked on our ElektrolyseV1 (EV1). <br> With the 
                EV1 we could increase the environmentally friendliness to 30%. <br>
                We do the most we can to make this Planet better. Even when we do
                small steps we try our best.

            We got on the stock market after our first year of development.    
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Sales</th>
                            <th>Stock</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>37%</td>
                            <td>127</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>49%</td>
                            <td>134</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>53%</td>
                            <td>138</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>67%</td>
                            <td>153</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            As you can see the stocks price increased by one 1/4 in only 1 year.
